Ribbons.Guide is a [progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) that allows you to keep track of your Pokémon and their Ribbons! This was developed as a love letter to the helpful and welcoming [r/PokémonRibbons](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonribbons/) community. Ribbons.Guide doesn't store or send any data anywhere—it's all saved on your device!

This project is not affiliated with Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokémon Company.
